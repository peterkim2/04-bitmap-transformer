## Description

For this assignment you will be building a bitmap (`.bmp`) reader and transformer. It will read a bitmap in from disk, run one or more color transforms on the bitmap and then write it out to a new file. This project will require the use of node buffers in order to manipulate binary data. Your project should include tests, as well as a `gulpfile.js`, `package.json`, `.eslintrc`, `README.md`, and a `.gitignore`. Make sure to run all your code through eslint. The process will look something like this:

1. open the original bitmap file using fs and read it into a buffer
2. convert the buffer header data into a Javascript Object (using constructors)
3. run a transform on the buffer directly
4. write the buffer to a new file

The wikipedia article found here [Bitmap Specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format) describes the byte specification of a "windows bitmap file." We'll be working with the simplest version, meaning no compression.

* your project should have three ***(or more)*** transforms
* invert the colors (***hint:*** subtract every color value from the max color value which is 255),
* greyscale the colors (***hint:*** multiply each color value by a constant, just make sure your values don't go over 255)
* (red|green|blue)scale the colors (***hint:*** same as above but only multiply one of the colors)

## Bonus:

* ability to handle various sized bitmap
* ability to handle LE and BE computers with a single if statement
* utilizes a command line interface (CLI)
* CLI can select the transforms
